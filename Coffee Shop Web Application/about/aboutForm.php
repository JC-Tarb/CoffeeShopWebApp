			<p>
			Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, 
			the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. The genus Coffea 
			is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in 
			Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and 
			Réunion in the Indian Ocean. Coffee plants are now cultivated 
			in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the 
			Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa. The two
			most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta. Once ripe, coffee 
			berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred 
			to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired
			flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water 
			to produce the beverage known as coffee.

				An Environmental Audit Committee <b><a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmenvaud/657/657.pdf"> (EAC) report </a></b>
				indicates that “2.5 billion coffee cups are used and thrown away each year in the UK […] but less 
				than 1 in 400 – just 0.25% – are recycled.” Alarming, And this is just one part of the waste 
				associated with enjoying a cup of coffee.
